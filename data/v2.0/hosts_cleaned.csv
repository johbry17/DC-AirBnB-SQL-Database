We love that; its the reason we travel as much as we do.  As far as potential short term tenants, I'd say (again, humbly) that we're trustworthy and relaxed.  We believe in leaving things nicer than we found them, whether that's apartments or people.  We like easy mornings,good books, and walking to discover new cities.  We're clean folks and prefer that of the places we stay. Add to that, we enjoy good coffee, one but not five glasses of wine with dinner, and spicy foods.  We're new to Air B'n'B but looking forward to using it on our 2 month honeymoon around north Africa and Europe. 

Nicole speaks German, and I a bit of Spanish and Arabic.  As far as our work, we're in the business of international development, specifically related to children.

We have enjoyed  wonderful conversations  with them and learned different cooking styles besides getting to know people's cultures in a more intimate fashion. 
We are huge lovers of music and I enjoy singing at church and other cultural venues.

So most people who have allergies do not feel a thing in the house  because there are 14 ft ceilings and the air circulation is great. )  
Being that I happen to do property management for a few years, and living in the nation's capitol ,we have enjoyed hosting a lot of interns , professionals, besides masters students who have stayed at the house at different times and  they have made for very enriching conversations !!! 

The neighborhood is just great and we are in the No. 1 area in town - You can just walk down to all the pubs, restaurants and clubs if you wish and the best part is that one could just walk right back home. Our neighborhood is quiet ,peaceful and the neighbors are just wonderful. When you come home to us, you will find the neighborhood very warm and welcoming. 
As a person- I am passionate about relationships, love traveling, love going to great concerts, a lover of gospel , jazz, reggae, pop and even some  classical music.As a christian ,I am very active with music at church .

I would love to have you stay at the house and help you to discover DC!
There is a lot to see and do in DC and so much of it is free ! ( Its yours for the viewing if you have the time and the inclination!)

I could go on - But I will leave you with this - I look forward to seeing each and every one of you and we will do our best to see that your stay is warm and comfortable! ( And if you get lucky ,you may just avail of some home cooked Indian food as well ) .....

I was born and raised in Brazil but left over 15 years ago to see the world. I can communicate in English, Portuguese, Spanish, and French.

My passion for hospitality arrived many years ago and took me four years through Hospitality University for my bachelor's degree. I worked in the Best Hotels in the World (Asia, Europe, Middle East, South America, and the US) for 14 years, including the best in DC. Now I'm currently an Interior Decorator in DC.

I work for a DC-based trade association, and love sharing our historic and conveniently located accommodations on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., all of which boast free parking (guests must request a pass prior to arrival), easy keyless entry, safe and walkable neighborhoods with abundant transportation options including bike-sharing, Metro, Uber, Lyft, and two efficient bus systems, and professionally cleaned units. 

We love our historic neighborhood, Capitol Hill, which is centrally located near the U.S. Senate, Supreme Court, Library of Congress, National Mall, Whole Foods, Eastern Market, Union Market and surrounding restaurants, and multiple transportation hubs, and parks—with a lack of hotels as the areas only deficiency. It truly is a neighborhood to immerse oneself as a local. 

We have hosted thousands of guests that have included business travelers here for advocacy work on the HIll, families on vacation, students conducting research at the library of congress, honeymooners, and couples introducing their spouses to their old college or early career stomping grounds. People have come from the farthest corners of the world. 

Are you a foodie? I am! Let me know if you would like the latest recommendations for the best eats in DC, which has experienced a restaurant boom in the past decade. Our electronic welcome packets received after booking are jam-packed with our favorite local restaurant suggestions. 

While we offer complimentary parking passes (by request in advance), our city was planned before automobiles were invented. If you're on the fence about renting a car-I think you're better off without one. Many hot spots are located within a walkable distance, and, public transportation is cheap and convenient. There is also a Capitol Bike Share location mere steps from our home. 

We live in a historic neighborhood with a mix of homes dated before the Civil War, many built during the Victorian era, and historic buildings with modern touches satisfying even the most curious students and lovers of architecture. They have been renovated when possible without detracting from their historic character. Our cleaners have enhanced protocols designed to keep or guests safe and comfortable. 

Guests receive keyless entry codes to access their reserved property. While not often, we on occasion can accommodate an early check-in, however, when it's not possible, we always offer guests the opportunity to store luggage and explore the neighborhood while the cleaners prepare for your arrival. Additionally, we can allow storage post-stay for a specific number of hours as well.  

Send me an inquiry and book your vacation!

I have decades of hospitality experience in restaurants and kitchens am thrilled to be hosting for the AirBnB community.

A little about me: 
I grew up to the tune of reveille and taps living across the river from an army base in southern Virginia where my folks settled to get away from the hustle and bustle of North Jersey. I attended culinary school at Johnson and Wales University and honed my skills in local kitchens until I moved to DC in 2009. After a short stint experimenting with the west cost way of life, it was clear DC was home so home I went. In 2015, after 15 years experience as a chef, I left my last professional kitchen as a chef and set out to start my own business. SaltSugarFire chef services was born and has since flourished. It's also provided a better work/life balance and encouraged my green thumb!

We're an eco-conscious couple who like to live life to its fullest, embrace the good things and good people that are all around, travel a bit, try different ethnic foods from all over the world, explore music from all genres, cook, and entertain in our house! 

In July of 2017, after living in DC's Columbia Heights neighborhood for 5 years and in DC since 2008, my wife and I bought this 104-year-old house (circa 1913) within 5 miles of the White House, and we love living here in our new neighborhood (called Petworth). We knocked out a bunch of walls and replaced just about everything in the house to make it nicer. It needed some serious TLC... Now we want to share it with others who share our love of travel and big-city life. 

My wife is from New Delhi, India, so we go there as often as we are able (not often enough, though). We met in Bloomington, Indiana while she was in graduate school and I was running for County Commissioner of Monroe County. Now we're living it up in the capital city with our 2 young kids (3 and 7). We love DC and feel that it is a real gem of a city. We'd love to share our favorite places with you, help you find the perfect restaurants, and help you find things to do that are off the beaten paths. 

PLEASE NOTE: We do have a cat, so if that's a problem, there's nothing we can do about that. He's a short-haired black tabby cat with some white patches, born in late 2021, and is very friendly, independent, and a bit shy until he warms up to you. His name is Curry (or Curry So Purry according to our kids). He likes people to be around, but he may hide a lot when first meeting new people. 

Our house is in a great neighborhood called Petworth. It's about a 12-minute walk to the nearest Metro subway station (called Georgia Ave-Petworth), and there are bus stops and Capital Bikeshare stations very close to our house, so it's easy to get around! Taxi cabs, Uber, Lyft, and public scooters are also easy to find if you'd rather go that way.

I attended Howard University and earned a B.B.A majoring in business administration (mgmt.). Three years fast forward, I returned to Howard University and secured a masters in social work. I also have a license in trichology and salon management. I currently reside here in Washington, DC with my husband and beautiful children. I'm a social worker of over 12 years worth of knowledge and resources in the surrounding DMV. 

I'm a full-time Airbnb host and I manage 2 other properties. I enjoy walking, dinning out at exquisite restaurants, DIY projects, cooking and cleaning. I'm passionate about reading, going to small music venues, and stand-up comedy. I enjoy watching movies, spending time outdoors amongst family and friends, and traveling. My friends describe me as witty, bubbly and energetic. I'm often perceived as a direct communicator. People often compliment me on being attentive. I keep a positive attitude and really enjoy life. My personal goal is to meet at least one new person a day, it makes life far more interesting. 

I starting hosting on Airbnb in 2019. I became an Airbnb host because I love meeting new people. What I love most about being an Airbnb host is sharing my home with people from all over the world. I listed my home (private room) on Airbnb because I want to connect with people from other cultures. I started sharing my spare room on Airbnb to help pay for our children's college education. Although my motivation to list on Airbnb was financial in nature, I really enjoy providing my guests with the best experience possible. I would like to meet more travelers through Airbnb! I live on-site and I'm available if you need anything. I truly love being of service to others. I'm happy to jump on a call and chat to my guests in making their experience more personable. I'm generally quite busy so I prefer to give my guests space to explore the city and all it has to offer. I typically don't spend much time with my guests, but I'm always available if they need me. I'm super social.

I’ve lived in Washington, DC since 2005 and consider it my home.  I started hosting on Airbnb in 2012 because I traveled on the weekends and wanted to give people an affordable space to stay. I’m excited to now have a brand new dedicated space to host people in.  At the end of 2018, I purchased a rowhome which I renovated. Now the lower level/basement unit is a dedicated space where Airbnb guests can stay at an affordable price.

I currently live in Washington, DC and New Mexico. I work for a nonprofit organization in digital fundraising and campaigning. I grew up in Orlando, Florida. Both of my listings are at these amazing locations. 
The first listing is an amazing home in Celebration, Florida. Celebration is a community and neighborhood located less than 10 minutes away from Walt Disney World. The house is spacious and sunny with a one bedroom suite. 

The second listing is in DC. This is an amazing home with open spaces, lots of windows and sunlight, a balcony on the second floor, and completely renovated and modernized. It is an 8 minute walk from the metro, which can take you to all DC attractions, monuments, and museums. The bus system in the city is great and you can also get to the White House or Capitol Hill through bus. You will stay in a cute and modern second floor bedroom. My mom and I live in the basement of this property, but I’m often away in New Mexico. 

What else can I tell you about me? I love philosophy and I'm currently looking for my career path. I studied such philosophy at Williams College in Massachusetts. Williams is a very small liberal arts college located in a beautiful town, extremely warm during the summers and wretched with snow during winter. Thankfully, I love both, the warmth and the snow. I'm looking forward to going back and visiting my family in Colombia, but I'd also love to travel to Thailand or Germany.

About the Manager:
Alec Smyth has decades of experience as a management consultant, which involved way too much travel and hospitality experience (approximately 200 flights per year.) In 2003 he started renting out the family's second home on an online platform, a brand new business model at the time. Over the years that activity grew into a future retirement plan with the addition of more properties, all of which are located on Capitol Hill and must pass a simple test... Would they be a place Alec and his family would enjoy staying themselves?

WHY STAY WITH US

I'm Bob with OC Beachfront Rentals! 

I am married to my beautiful wife Teresa and have two kids Blake (13) and Brooke (12). I grew up in Northern, VA  and went to Ocean City, MD every summer.  We LOVE it.  I enjoy coaching my son's flag football team, watching my daughter dance, surfing and playing sand volleyball. I also love just a nice day at the beach with family and friends. 

I started OC Beachfront Rentals after using Airbnb a few years ago as a guest when we traveled to Hawaii, Miami and even Ocean City. Through these travels, I've been fortunate to learn what a good Airbnb experience (and host) looks like. A great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome location, and the ability to do the things you love! We started OC Beachfront Rentals with the goal of providing this level of service to all our Guests.  Today we proudly have over 30 stunning Beach properties.

I try to ensure that each and every guest that I host walks away with the very best experience possible!  When I first started my business and still today, I try to answer every phone call or email I get within five minutes. I try and do that today so go ahead and try me you will be amazed at my service. 

-Bob

We are known for our distinctively furnished apartments in popular locations, and for our attentive service. You’ll find that our rates are quite reasonable. If you're looking for a safe, comfortable place with fabulous amenities and Wi-Fi (we know you need the Wi-Fi!) in the Boston MA area, Washington DC, Miami FL or very close to NYC in Jersey City or Hoboken, we'd love to host you. Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge. 

Please contact us to confirm the exact availability of the apartment you are interested in. We’d love to host you (and your family) for your vacation or business trip.

My name is Mai (pronounced 'my'). I'm 38 years old and have two wonderful boys. By day I work as an engineer, by night I watch Peppa Pig (over and over) and am constantly changing diapers. 

I was a nomad basically from my mid 20's until my early 30's. I've hit some big cities such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Lisbon, Barcelona, Madrid, Tokyo, Seoul, Sydney and of course Ho Chi Minh (in case my name didn't give it away). In being well traveled, I understand the value in being immersed in new cultures and environments. 

I started to host Airbnb because I'm blown away with the Airbnb concept after having paid up the wazoo for hotel rooms. If you are thinking of staying in my home, please consider me a good friend who's letting you stay in their home (except you have to give me money :)
