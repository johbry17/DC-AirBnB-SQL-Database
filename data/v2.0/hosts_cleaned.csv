In 2015, after 15 years experience as a chef, I left my last professional kitchen as a chef and set out to start my own business. SaltSugarFire chef services was born and has since flourished.

I have a degree in history and enjoy seeing and reading about history.  I've been part of a book club for about 15 years and have enjoyed reading some great books and meeting some great people.  I am curious about life and search on the Internet for many things so that I can learn.

Max and I really enjoy traveling - both in the U.S. and abroad.  Max grew up in Italy and is fluent in Italian.  I can speak some German.

We live in Washington, DC and love to travel. When we travel together, we like to find local food markets, restaurants, trails, and yoga studios. After using AirBnB for some of our travels we decided we should make the apartment in our cute bungalow home available to other travelers. 

Susan is a 2D and 3D exhibition designer, who currently is redesigning a nature center. Kara supports academic programs in higher ed. 

Our everyday life is quite local: growing food, shopping at the food coop, cooking, baking, and walking nature trails are all within minutes of our house in NW DC. We enjoy getting to know DC's neighborhoods, trails and parks, and coffee shop haunts.

10930361,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/10930361,Kim,2013-12-31,"Washington, DC","TRAVEL: My sophomore year in college I headed out of the U.S. for the first time with a backpack full of books to study literature and drama in the U.K. and Ireland and I've never looked back. I've since studied in Guatemala, Argentina, Italy and The Netherlands. I lived for years in Ecuador and Mexico. I fell in love with culture and how it shapes every part of our lives, even how we think. My best travel experiences are always the ones where I have an unplanned encounter with people I meet along the way. Two very dear relationships in my life today began in the Piazza del Campo in Siena Italy -- 10 years apart! 

HOSPITALITY: My love of hospitality began in Guatemala when I lived with a family for the summer and was deepened when I spent a month in a township in Capetown, SA. The house in Capetown was quite small. My friends insisted that I take their bed and they slept in the living room on the floor. I have since made my home a gathering space for friends and for years was part of an informal house of hospitality where we hosted guests from around the world, well before the days of Airbnb. Now that I have my own home in DC, I am THRILLED to be able to open it up to guests from Airbnb. I hope we get a chance to meet.

LIFE IN WASHINGTON: I moved to DC five years ago. I have grown to love this city, its history, gorgeous architecture, different neighborhood vibes, endlessly interesting people, amazing food scene (cooking, and well, eating, are my other great passions), and plenty of free stuff to do. The day I moved into my house, although it was a cold December day, my neighbors came out  to greet me. Within 2 weeks I was offered Christmas dinner by my next door neighbor because she knew I wasn't traveling to Minnesota for the holidays. DC is much more the nation's seat of power.

I have 2 spacious bedrooms on the upper floor of my house that I share out one is a King sized mattress and the other is a Queen sized.  Both rooms share one very large bathroom.

I love people and consider myself very friendly. I thrive on honest ,open communication and enjoy meeting and taking care of people from around the world. Being that the home is large enough for the three of us, we have enjoyed residents from all over the world. We have enjoyed  wonderful conversations  with them and learned different cooking styles besides getting to know people's cultures in a more intimate fashion. 
We are huge lovers of music and I enjoy singing at church and other cultural venues. 
We have 3 cats but they are only allowed on 2 out of the 4 floors .They are adorable. ( On of the cats is mostly outside, the other hides in my bedroom all day and night and there would only be one to contend with and she has lately been hanging out in my bedroom as well ). So most people who have allergies do not feel a thing in the house  because there are 14 ft ceilings and the air circulation is great. )  
Being that I happen to do property management for a few years, and living in the nation's capitol ,we have enjoyed hosting a lot of interns , professionals, besides masters students who have stayed at the house at different times and  they have made for very enriching conversations !!! 

The neighborhood is just great and we are in the No. 1 area in town - You can just walk down to all the pubs, restaurants and clubs if you wish and the best part is that one could just walk right back home. Our neighborhood is quiet ,peaceful and the neighbors are just wonderful. When you come home to us, you will find the neighborhood very warm and welcoming. 
As a person- I am passionate about relationships, love traveling, love going to great concerts, a lover of gospel , jazz, reggae, pop and even some  classical music.As a christian ,I am very active with music at church .

I would love to have you stay at the house and help you to discover DC!
There is a lot to see and do in DC and so much of it is free ! ( Its yours for the viewing if you have the time and the inclination!)

I could go on - But I will leave you with this - I look forward to seeing each and every one of you and we will do our best to see that your stay is warm and comfortable! ( And if you get lucky ,you may just avail of some home cooked Indian food as well ) ..... 

So , come check us out and enjoy our nations' capitol in the bargain !

I've done a lot of travelling and love talking to fellow explorers. You'll see some remnants of that around the house. If you like a good conversation, I do too!

We've lived in the vibrant Truxton Circle neighborhood for the past 6 years, and recently bought a home on the Chesapeake Bay in North Beach, MD.   After staying in our first Airbnb in Europe three years ago,  we drank the kool-aid and decided to become hosts.   We usual stay in Airbnbs when we travel and our goal is to learn from those experiences to improve our hosting skills.
We like to eat and make a point to eat our way through our travels.  To burn off those extra calories,  Graig enjoys swimming and biking.   I get my extra energy out on the soccer field in a Sunday co-ed league.  And we both enjoy our careers.   I work for a large non-profit as a video editor and animator; saving the world one video at a time.   Graig knows all things computer and works in IT.   He doubles as my on-call tech support.

Guests receive keyless entry codes to access their reserved apartment.

As a guest in any short term rental, I am always careful to take very good care of the home. I've always wanted to run a B&B, so I'm excited to get my chance now, as we rent out our home ahead of a planned expansion. We love our neighborhood in DC, and know that guests will too. We are happy to make every guest as comfortable in our home as can be and also very happy to share tips for getting around DC and making the most of your stay.

Bueno - siempre he querido viajar, y he viajado varias veces a Cuba, porque mi trabajo tenia que ver con mejorar las relaciones entre Cuba y los EEUU. Me agradaria mucho hacer un viaje con mi familia en los proximos meses... Como huesped, soy muy cuidadoso de la casa rentada, siempre. Para mi, siempre ha sido preferible quedarme con una familia o en casa de una familia, en vez de un hotel.

I've spent most of the past 14 years here, with some time back in Brooklyn and Puerto Rico, and now enjoy teaching adults online, and in-person adult ESL outside of pandemic times.

I've lived/worked/taught in Spain, the Czech Republic, Thailand, South Korea, Argentina, and Mexico, and traveled solo through much of Latin America and a bunch of other amazing places. 

I've worked in photography, writing, and development, and I was a director of global education programs for youth while living in a collective house of people working toward social justice.  Now my Argentine-Texan partner and I enjoy hosting chill US and international folks here in the vibrant District of Columbia. 

We have a sweet young housemate as well, our five-year-old daughter who loves to laugh, eat snacks, and talk about animals. Most folks think she's value-added cuteness, and we haven't had noise complaints from the second floor. If you just don't like kids, though, this isn't the spot for you.

In 2014, he graduated with a master’s degree in music from James Madison University, where he was a teaching assistant and active performer. Long before graduation, he was playing with top performers in both countries.</p><p>Nirenberg was raised in a family of musicians and studied music since childhood. Becoming a musician was a natural path for him to take. His father plays viola in the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra based in Rio and teaches chamber music at UFRJ. His mother is a gifted pianist who also became a teacher.</p><p>His paternal grandfather, Jaques Nirenberg, was a doctor and also a respected violinist with the Brazilian String Quartet. For over five decades they performed in concert halls around the world, including Carnegie Hall and Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.  Michel would study classical piano, violin, guitar and clarinet before taking up the saxophone at age 15. The horn was a gift from his parents. Although many family members play music, Michel was unique in making that his primary occupation.</p><p>His musical style is contemporary Brazilian instrumental music. His latest album shows a fascinating range of influences including choro, the first characteristically Brazilian genre of urban popular music. Choro is characterized by virtuosity, improvisation, and subtle modulations, and is full of syncopation and counterpoint. Nirenberg has the wherewithal to treat it in lively new ways. On the same disc, he performs straight ahead jazz and makes an unexpected leap into the avant-garde on the bonus track.</p><p>For a long season of his musical life, Nirenberg’s principal influences were classical; later he immersed himself in various styles of jazz and Brazilian styles (choro, samba, and baião, maracatu), and he listened to multi-instrumentalist Hermeto Pascoal and guitarist/pianist Egberto Gismonte.</p><p>His first recording as a leader is <em>Retrato </em>(<em>Portrait</em>) is set for release on the Carioca label in 2015. It boasts Brazilian musicians such as virtuosos Leonardo Lucini on bass and Alejandro Lucini on drums and guitarist Rogério Souza. Argentine guitarist Dani Cortaza and American pianist Alex Brown complete the roster of highly accomplished musicians with international reputations.</p><p>Nirenberg is one of the founders of the Philharmonic Band of Rio de Janeiro and was a featured soloist in 2012. He performed classical saxophone solos with the Brazilian Youth Symphony Orchestra and Fundarte Chamber Orchestra. He was also a soloist with the Symphonic Orchestra and jazz ensemble at UFRJ.  </p><p>Nirenberg’s journey to the U.S. began with a competition in Brazil known as the Concurso Jovens Músicos--Música no Museu, or Competition for Young Musicians, Music in the Museum. After several rounds of competition with talented musicians from throughout Brazil, he won second place and the opportunity for an assistantship at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In 2014, he received a master of music degree in performance -saxophone – an achievement all the more impressive because Nirenberg faced the challenge of mastering English while undertaking his studies.  Besides English and Portuguese, he is fluent in Spanish and speaks some French, reflecting the wide range of world cultures that influence his approach to music.</p>",,,,False,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/33054104/profile_pic/1431287786/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/33054104/profile_pic/1431287786/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Bloomingdale,1,1,"['email', 'phone']",True,False

Most of my experiences are characterized by geography and a love of the earth. That said, I grew up in the far northwest corner of South Carolina near in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Alot of my middle and high school memories are characterized by hiking and wandering around the rural areas too elevated for agriculture and too lowland for true Blue Ridge forests. 

I studied Meteorology in Mobile, Alabama. This was a pretty big change for me, but I took well to the beaches, New Orleans, and the Mobile River Delta, which has at times been called ""The Amazon of America"".

I spent a brief amount of time in what is known as the Capital of Louisiana's Cajun Country, Lafayette, Louisiana. Though I had trouble finding access to kayaks to enjoy the slow bayous with, the vibrant culture kept me company. 

Today, I live in Washington DC and do environmental analysis. Nature and the weather remains an important aspect of who I am. Music also remains important to me, though I'm limited in my abilities to play my guitar. My exploratory habits have turned urban, and I enjoy biking around the region. If I've requested to stay with you, it's likely I'm looking for a 'base' to sleep at while I either explore the urban center of the closest city or the nearest mountain, river, or coast to you. If you're looking at this wondering if you should stay with me, I hope you'll choose to visit DC for both the museums and monuments as well as the urban culture of the US's Capital, even if you stay at a different listing.

Close to a good wine shop, coffee shop, and world class museums? Even better. But we also like to get out of the city and off the grid. 

Politics aside, we think Capitol Hill is one of the best neighborhoods in the US--full of beautiful tree-lined streets and stately rowhouses, and shockingly tranquil for its location in the heart of the nation's capital!

I work for a DC-based trade association, and love sharing our historic and conveniently located accommodations on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., all of which boast free parking (guests must request a pass prior to arrival), easy keyless entry, safe and walkable neighborhoods with abundant transportation options including bike-sharing, Metro, Uber, Lyft, and two efficient bus systems, and professionally cleaned units. 

We love our historic neighborhood, Capitol Hill, which is centrally located near the U.S. Senate, Supreme Court, Library of Congress, National Mall, Whole Foods, Eastern Market, Union Market and surrounding restaurants, and multiple transportation hubs, and parks—with a lack of hotels as the areas only deficiency. It truly is a neighborhood to immerse oneself as a local. 

We have hosted thousands of guests that have included business travelers here for advocacy work on the HIll, families on vacation, students conducting research at the library of congress, honeymooners, and couples introducing their spouses to their old college or early career stomping grounds. People have come from the farthest corners of the world. 

Are you a foodie? I am! Let me know if you would like the latest recommendations for the best eats in DC, which has experienced a restaurant boom in the past decade. Our electronic welcome packets received after booking are jam-packed with our favorite local restaurant suggestions. 

While we offer complimentary parking passes (by request in advance), our city was planned before automobiles were invented. If you're on the fence about renting a car-I think you're better off without one. Many hot spots are located within a walkable distance, and, public transportation is cheap and convenient. There is also a Capitol Bike Share location mere steps from our home. 

We live in a historic neighborhood with a mix of homes dated before the Civil War, many built during the Victorian era, and historic buildings with modern touches satisfying even the most curious students and lovers of architecture. They have been renovated when possible without detracting from their historic character. Our cleaners have enhanced protocols designed to keep or guests safe and comfortable. 

Guests receive keyless entry codes to access their reserved property. While not often, we on occasion can accommodate an early check-in, however, when it's not possible, we always offer guests the opportunity to store luggage and explore the neighborhood while the cleaners prepare for your arrival. Additionally, we can allow storage post-stay for a specific number of hours as well.  

Send me an inquiry and book your vacation!

About our CEO:
""Overall, I am mostly a father, a husband, an entrepreneur, a traveler, a tree hugger,  and a friend to the environment. I love to travel and try to take a yearly vacation with my family and explore the world. During our travels, I find it easier and more efficient to stay with other Airbnb hosts.  Hotels are expensive and would require the booking of 2 rooms. Not very family friendly.

Mostly, I love meeting people from around this beautiful world and look forward to meeting future travelers and hosts.""

Anand is a native born Washingtonian, who has watched his city go through a roller coaster of change over the last 55+ years. He has been raised here and has worked as a White House photojournalist in the family owned photography business.  

Lisa Marie, who is a full time Interior Artist and Designer in Washington DC, traces her roots from the rolling vineyards and farmlands of the beautiful Finger Lakes of up-state New York.  Her many projects include artistic design, consulting, staging, project management and rehab of numerous high-end commercial and residential projects, in and around Washington DC.

Together, Anand and Lisa have combined their artistic talents to create a dazzling and memorable experience for guests and visitors.

For Anand, hospitality goes all the way back to his father's and mother's humble home, where an endless line of world visitors would stop by on their way through the nation's capital.  As a rule, no one ever left their house without first eating a hot meal and sharing good times with the family.

From Lisa Marie's historic hometown of Seneca Falls, hospitality has been a long tradition, with the many famous bed and breakfast homes in her area. She learned early in life that every traveller's visit and needs are both special and unique.

We're an eco-conscious couple who like to live life to its fullest, embrace the good things and good people that are all around, travel a bit, try different ethnic foods from all over the world, explore music from all genres, cook, and entertain in our house! 

In July of 2017, after living in DC's Columbia Heights neighborhood for 5 years and in DC since 2008, my wife and I bought this 104-year-old house (circa 1913) within 5 miles of the White House, and we love living here in our new neighborhood (called Petworth). We knocked out a bunch of walls and replaced just about everything in the house to make it nicer. It needed some serious TLC... Now we want to share it with others who share our love of travel and big-city life. 

My wife is from New Delhi, India, so we go there as often as we are able (not often enough, though). We met in Bloomington, Indiana while she was in graduate school and I was running for County Commissioner of Monroe County. Now we're living it up in the capital city with our 2 young kids (3 and 7). We love DC and feel that it is a real gem of a city. We'd love to share our favorite places with you, help you find the perfect restaurants, and help you find things to do that are off the beaten paths. 

PLEASE NOTE: We do have a cat, so if that's a problem, there's nothing we can do about that. He's a short-haired black tabby cat with some white patches, born in late 2021, and is very friendly, independent, and a bit shy until he warms up to you. His name is Curry (or Curry So Purry according to our kids). He likes people to be around, but he may hide a lot when first meeting new people. 

Our house is in a great neighborhood called Petworth. It's about a 12-minute walk to the nearest Metro subway station (called Georgia Ave-Petworth), and there are bus stops and Capital Bikeshare stations very close to our house, so it's easy to get around! Taxi cabs, Uber, Lyft, and public scooters are also easy to find if you'd rather go that way.

22289377,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/22289377,Douglas,2014-10-08,"Potomac, MD","Greetings!

Here is a little about me:

I attended Plandome Road Elementary School and Manhasset Junior High School in Manhasset, Long Island, New York. Growing up, I was an avid football player and baseball player and tuba player, and I was a camp counselor at Homestead Camp, a Unitarian summer camp in Brewster, New York.

 I went to George School, a Quaker co-ed boarding school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where a generous grading system and a skillful local photographer contributed to my being named a national scholar athlete. At Harvard, I was the thirty-seventh midfielder on the lacrosse team, and I was in the Experimental Theatre. I was a teacher in Gulale, Ethiopia. As part of the college’s Peace Corps program.

 I came to Washington at age 24 because I was interested in the political life. One of my college professors recommended me for a job writing mail for Congressman Stephen J. Solarz, who represented the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York. In 1976, I joined the presidential campaign of Morris Udall, who hoped (unsuccessfully) to join Abe Lincoln and Jack Kennedy on the list of former congressmen who got elected president. The nomination instead went to Governor Jimmy Carter, who won the general election in 1976, about the time I entered Georgetown Law School. One of my professors there recommended me to the office of Vice President Walter Mondale, and I was an intern in his office, working in an architectural marvel--the Old Executive Office building. 

In 1980 my internship led to my becoming Assistant Counsel to the Carter-Mondale Re-Election Committee, a campaign that resulted in a landslide victory for Ronald Reagan. His victory was so large that my hometown congressman, Democrat Lester Wolf, was defeated, which inspired me to go home to Manhasset, and to spend a year and a half seeking the nomination to run for congress myself. A stronger candidate won the nomination, and I moved back to Washington, DC, and hung up my shingle as a trial lawyer.  (I am such a good attorney that I can look at a contract and tell you within five seconds whether it is oral or written!) I practice in the building that contains our Airbnb English basement. 

I can occasionally be seen strumming a Larrivee dreadnought guitar with cracks of unknown origin, and I understand Bob Dylan’s lyrics better than anyone, including Mr. Dylan.

However, my greatest pleasures have been coaching roller hockey, basketball, baseball and soccer, avocations that were facilitated by having five kids.

Your staying with us is greatly appreciated, and I am enjoying seeing my kids’ college tuition balances go down as a result! 

Enjoy!

“One who travels far knows much.”

Hello travelers ~ Thanks for taking interest in my page and profile! 

I’m Daisy. As an Airbnb guest for many years, I have finally gathered the courage to host and share my humble abode with you. 

So go on, step into a district resident’s shoes for a few days -- enjoy the DC scene with tree-lined neighborhood streets, walk to you favorite brunch place to prolong a lazy morning, and pedal down to the Mall to admire our national treasures. 

And if you have visited my home already, you can probably tell, I like things from an older and simpler time. Don’t let that fool you, I’m not old-fashioned at all. I love the intricacy of new human connections brought on by the modern world. Hence, I always savor the rewarding sensation that comes from experiencing someone else’s world for a few days at a time. 

Though, I am no world traveler (but perhaps you are!), I hope my place -- your temporary home -- is comfortable to you and all visitors from around the globe. I truly hope you enjoy the peace and convenience of it as much as I do. 

Cheers. Travel on.

I read incessantly -- other people watch TV, but I read -- the Washington Post, the New York Times, political books and also romances,  sci-fi, and murder mysteries.  You'll find some of the latter in a basket in the apartment.

Airbnb asks whether I have a life motto?

In my spare time I enjoy cooking, tasting new wines, watching movies, and traveling.  Some of my favorite destinations are Tokyo, Los Angeles, Miami, Paris, Venice, and the Caribbean.  Places I hope to visit soon are Southeast Asia, Bora Bora and Greece.  

My DC home originally belonged to my grandparents and it has always been a safe haven and place of comfort, while my NY home inspires creativity and relaxation after an exciting day in the city.

For me, space matters.  It really matters.  A home should serve multiple purposes, chief among them are comfort and cleanliness.  Friends sometimes call me OCD because I am very particular about how space is kept.  This is a good thing for guests because it means I've really attempted to cover all the details.

I currently live in Washington, DC and New Mexico. I work for a nonprofit organization in digital fundraising and campaigning. I grew up in Orlando, Florida. Both of my listings are at these amazing locations. 
The first listing is an amazing home in Celebration, Florida. Celebration is a community and neighborhood located less than 10 minutes away from Walt Disney World. The house is spacious and sunny with a one bedroom suite. 

The second listing is in DC. This is an amazing home with open spaces, lots of windows and sunlight, a balcony on the second floor, and completely renovated and modernized. It is an 8 minute walk from the metro, which can take you to all DC attractions, monuments, and museums. The bus system in the city is great and you can also get to the White House or Capitol Hill through bus. You will stay in a cute and modern second floor bedroom. My mom and I live in the basement of this property, but I’m often away in New Mexico. 

What else can I tell you about me? I love philosophy and I'm currently looking for my career path. I studied such philosophy at Williams College in Massachusetts. Williams is a very small liberal arts college located in a beautiful town, extremely warm during the summers and wretched with snow during winter. Thankfully, I love both, the warmth and the snow. I'm looking forward to going back and visiting my family in Colombia, but I'd also love to travel to Thailand or Germany.

I'd love to share this beautiful home with you. Please take a look. I am a very kind host, who loves clean spaces with light. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have.

The flower on the pillow, the water bottle by the bed, the plugs within easy reach, the high-end bath amenities and coffeemaker you would have for yourself, art and beautiful design, and delightful little surprises like locally made dark raw chocolate and dried fruit on the coffee table.  
When I decided to become an AirBnB host a few months ago, it was because I wanted to share my love of beautiful spaces and the experience of being cared for. I wanted to connect to people whom I will never meet and give them this experience because in the end, we are all connected as one humanity.  

And so far, all of my guests, unknowingly, have repeated exactly this feeling, that my home felt loving and that they felt cared for.  They have left me notes, even flowers and business cards, to extend our connection.  And this gives me great joy.

Running is one of my hobbies and I'm lucky to run in one of the worlds best park...beautiful Central Park.  Every season has its charm and it feels that I have a different park every 3-4 months.

I've been fortunate enough to call this house my home since 2015. I am a social creature who loves bringing folks together and being surrounded by good people, delicious food and the flow of good booze. I have been Pzifer vaxxed and boosted. 

My work requires me to be very active, which works well with my bubbly energy. I've worked in education, as well as the distilling and beer industry, and I continue my love for these still. My hobbies include scouring for amazing, reasonably priced vintage pieces of furniture, talking to, watering and admiring all of my plants (I'm bordering on crazy plant lady), wearing, collecting and selling vintage clothes, co-hosting a beer podcast and beer shares, working in the garden and around the house. Coming up very poor with a not so great childhood, I find myself sitting in my house, feeling thankful of where all of my hard work and resilience has led me. The year 2020 took a lot from me, but I was able to still stay in my happy place, aka, my house, but I now find myself with a pretty rad, rarely used basement and wanting to share that space with you on my quest to become a SuperHost. 

If you are into MCM, want to check out my pretty decent vinyl collection, or just geek over some gin or beer, just ask. When I am not working on the never ending to-do lists, I am listening to music in my living room, hanging out on the patio, pulling up weeds (ugh crab grass), or hanging out with friends a local brewery. 

I look forward to meeting you and showing you my southern NC hospitality while being your DC home away from home.

Please read the house rules and listing carefully and that will answer most of your questions.  I live at the intersection of R street NE and Lincoln street NE Washington D.C. 20002.   This should help you answer any location based questions ;)

My name is Robert and I grew fond of the idea of hosting short term guests during a stay I experienced in Osaka Japan, I was inspired by my experience there. Our Japanese hosts were so thoughtful in the approach they took in welcoming us. Through that experience I found myself with an urge to create that same experience for others. Out of that was  born a passion for hospitality. Growing up I was always the artsy fartsy type so the transition for me was natural, paired with my logistics background in my Naval career, I took a new passion for hospitality, a natural inclination to create and a trained eye for attention to detail and found Air BNB, now I am on a quest to deliver 100 thousand 5 star experiences for my guests with a goal to grow my hospitality company worldwide!

I'm Bob with OC Beachfront Rentals! 

I am married to my beautiful wife Teresa and have two kids Blake (13) and Brooke (12). I grew up in Northern, VA  and went to Ocean City, MD every summer.  We LOVE it.  I enjoy coaching my son's flag football team, watching my daughter dance, surfing and playing sand volleyball. I also love just a nice day at the beach with family and friends. 

I started OC Beachfront Rentals after using Airbnb a few years ago as a guest when we traveled to Hawaii, Miami and even Ocean City. Through these travels, I've been fortunate to learn what a good Airbnb experience (and host) looks like. A great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome location, and the ability to do the things you love! We started OC Beachfront Rentals with the goal of providing this level of service to all our Guests.  Today we proudly have over 30 stunning Beach properties.

I try to ensure that each and every guest that I host walks away with the very best experience possible!  When I first started my business and still today, I try to answer every phone call or email I get within five minutes. I try and do that today so go ahead and try me you will be amazed at my service.

DC’s Airbnb laws changed (were formed:) And now we’re back and hosting from our family home. Two former DC politicos with three children, one of which just went off to college GO ARMY!!.. so we have loads of extra space. As hosts, we don't expect you to do anything we wouldn't do as guests. So if you simply make sure all trash is in the provided trash bin(s), and all dirty towels are in the provided hamper, we’ll take care of the rest. We are hardcore about a clean and comfortable space.. the guest suite is the entire lower level of our home, minus the locked storage room and HVAC. We’ve used the space to host our own family for years, but as our number of children living at home begins to dwindle, we have space to spare. So please, enjoy your stay. 

And if, by chance, you’re celebrating something/someone special during your stay, feel free to let us know. We (mostly me:) would love to blow up balloons, sprinkle confetti, and/or practice my budding hobby of folding towels into animals that don’t exist:) All practice opportunities are welcome! *cough* needed:)",,,100.0,False,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fcfb20f2-aff4-4023-9c80-7c1ad35d7627.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fcfb20f2-aff4-4023-9c80-7c1ad35d7627.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Northwest Washington,1,1,"['email', 'phone']",True,True

We are big fans of Airbnb and use it stay in wonderful places all over the world.

We wanted to list our apartment and share our place with the Airbnb family.

We live in Washington DC and love to travel, and especially love Paris. Probably the best way to see Paris is to walk all day exploring different neighborhoods.  We'll walk all day -- drop in a gallery here or there, eat lunch in an intriguing place, hunt antiques, hang out at the Apple store, do some shopping at some favorite local places, and then go out in the evenings for a fabulous meal, Paris-style.

We'll share with you our lists of favorite Paris things to do that we've built after years of visiting Richard's father and mother-in-law, a multi-generational Parisian with fine-honed recommendations.

My name is Mai (pronounced 'my'). I'm 38 years old and have two wonderful boys. By day I work as an engineer, by night I watch Peppa Pig (over and over) and am constantly changing diapers. 

I was a nomad basically from my mid 20's until my early 30's. I've hit some big cities such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Lisbon, Barcelona, Madrid, Tokyo, Seoul, Sydney and of course Ho Chi Minh (in case my name didn't give it away). In being well traveled, I understand the value in being immersed in new cultures and environments. 

I started to host Airbnb because I'm blown away with the Airbnb concept after having paid up the wazoo for hotel rooms. If you are thinking of staying in my home, please consider me a good friend who's letting you stay in their home (except you have to give me money :)

Today, as a person that loves people, I am forever grateful for my Family and friends who served as an oasis of hope. I am grateful to the opportunity to continuously learn and grow both as a worker and an individual.

In the past few years, then, I have worked in several different sales areas; from higher education to travel and tourism. I have explored teaching English to English learners, visa policies, and international out reach and I have loved every second of every opportunity! Having also worked in finance and food services, I am reassured that helping and serving people has always been (and continues to be) my main concern.

Moving forward, here are a few things to know more about me:
-I have BIG ideas, and I pride myself on the execution of those ideas.
-I have worked many jobs in my lifetime, and ALL of them have reinforced that I am a helper and a healer by nature. Finance might not have been 'my thing,' but I was still pretty great at that too!
-I am looking to prove to the world just how much of a Master of Social Work I am, so far... Please note, however, that I am an avid learner and I welcome to opportunity to prove myself in new endeavors.
-I am artistic, ambidextrous, altruistic, and I adore alliteration.
-Writing is a personal forte, and so is being neurotically organized.
-I also love meeting new people, including professional acquaintances and prospective partners. Please feel free to reach out to me!
-My mom was right when she said that I was never good at following the ""Don't Talk To Strangers"" rule.
